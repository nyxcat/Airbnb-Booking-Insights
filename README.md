# Data Science NanoDegree Term 2 - Write a Blog Post
## Introduction
In this repo, I used the Seattle Airbnb open data to explore the following questions:
- Which neighborhoods has the most expensive listings?
- What are the portions of best reviewed listings in different neighborhoods?
- What is the property type distribution over different neighborhoods?
- Can we create a model to predict the market price for an Airbnb listing?

## Results
The answers to the above questions are in the same order as follows:
- The top 3 most expensive areas are Magnolia, Queen Anne and Downtown 
- The neighborhood with the most portion of highly rated listings are Central area, West Seattle, and Queen Anne 
- If you are choosing downtown Seattle, the only option for you is a dorm. However, if you are looking for a special experience of camping in a yurt, go to West Seattle!
- Listing price mostly correlates with the number of bedrooms, bathrooms and accommodates. Offering private rooms is also likely to increase the price
